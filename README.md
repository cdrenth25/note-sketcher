# note-sketcher

This script requires Python 3 to be downloaded on your device. You can run this code without going through a Python interface though. \n
This is just a README file explaining what this python script does. \n
This script creates lines and dots representing generic music notes using Python's Turtle functions to draw the lines and dots. \n
The .py file generates a window containing 4 buttons, each of which generate a similar Turtle window with some "music notes" in it. The different buttons generate increasingly complex arrangements of "notes" as per original client's request.
